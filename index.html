      <h2 id="about">About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a software engineer with a passion for building scalable and
        efficient applications. I have experience in various programming
        languages and frameworks, and I enjoy solving complex problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am a student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am
        pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with concentrations
        in Computer Systems and Computational Biology.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2025, I will be interning at Amazon as a Software
        Development Engineer Intern on the AWS Artifact team. Previously, in the
        summer of 2024, I was a software engineer intern at insitro, where I
        worked on the laboratory information management system (LIMS) team.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I enjoy playing and watching sports, especially soccer
        and Formula 1. I am an avid Manchester United fan and have watched every
        game for the last 8 seasons.

            Inspired by the damage caused by recent wildfires in California, we
            developed and presented a package to predict wildfire spread and
            position firefighting resources to maintain integrity of vital
            evacuation routes for as long as possible, all in 24 hours. We
            overcame a lack of sufficient wildfire spread data by simulating
            wildfire spread influenced by factors such as terrain slope, canopy,
            and weather conditions. Additionally, we presented the ability to
            transform road networks into a weighted graph, allowing for
            multi-agent allocation without the need for intercommunication.

            Within 24 hours, we developed and presented a package to provide
            hyperlocal dynamic navigation instructions to users of outdoor
            venues (think conferences, festivals, concerts, etc.) using
            drone-based aerial crowd detection and mapping, allowing drones to
            take off within seconds of inputting the address of the venue. We
            overcame vision challenges, showing that crowds can be accurately
            estimated by detecting the members that comprise their exterior and
            tracing the polygon they create. Additionally, we presented the

                  Students will learn to choose and apply supervised learning
                  methods for classification (e.g., naive Bayes, perceptron,
                  SVM, logistic regression) and regression (e.g., linear and
                  ridge regression), as well as unsupervised techniques such as
                  clustering and dimensionality reduction. The course emphasizes
                  foundational mathematics, including probability, linear
                  algebra, and calculus, to derive and understand machine
                  learning algorithms. Key principles like model selection,
                  overfitting, cross-validation, and regularization are covered.
                  Students will implement algorithms and analyze results from
                  real and synthetic datasets.

                  guiding, research-based premise for the course is that readers
                  in professional contexts are busy, actively look for the
                  information they need, and deserve to get that information in
                  a clear and accessible way. In this course, you will

                  series of projects that put real readers and users of
                  documents at the center your writing process. Through genres
                  like job application packages, proposals, presentations of

                  string compression; string data structures such as suffix
                  trees, suffix arrays, and searchable compressed indices; and
                  the Borrows-Wheeler transform. Applications of these
                  techniques in genomics will be presented, including genome
                  assembly, transcript assembly, whole-genome alignment, gene
                  expression quantification, read mapping, and search of large
                  sequence databases.</span

                  from covering the major topics in cognitive psychology
                  (language, memory, visual processing, attention and cognitive
                  control), it includes an introduction to some of the most
                  recent approaches to studying human cognition. The course is
                  set up to highlight the connection between cognitive studies
                  and skills in various majors such as computer science, math,
                  statistics, and medicine. It is also structured to foster the

                  >A central issue in Western philosophy has been whether reason
                  or experience (or some of both?) provides the foundations for
                  human knowledge. This course explores that question by looking
                  at various "empiricist" vs. "rationalist" debates from the
                  17th century to the present day. We will focus on the problems
                  encountered in trying to give an adequate account of the our
                  knowledge of the external world, the structure of our minds,
                  and the nature and limitations of human knowledge. The scope
                  of our investigation will extend to the nature of mathematical
                  knowledge, to "thought experiments" in both science and
                  philosophy, and to "nativism" vs. "empiricism" issues in
                  contemporary cognitive science and moral theory. The course
                  has two main goals: (1) to study key metaphysical and
                  epistemological issues surrounding the nature of human
                  knowledge and (2) to help improve our analytical and critical
                  skills by extracting and evaluating various relevant
                  philosophical arguments.</span

                  >An introduction to programming based on a "functional" model
                  of computation. The functional model is a natural
                  generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that
                  describe the output of a computation in terms of its
                  inputs---that is, as a function. But instead of being confined
                  to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model
                  extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types,
                  including not only aggregates built up from other types, but
                  also functions themselves as values. This course is an
                  introduction to programming that is focused on the central
                  concepts of function and type. One major theme is the
                  interplay between inductive types, which are built up
                  incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over
                  inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural
                  induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time
                  complexity of a recursive function. Another major theme is the
                  role of types in structuring large programs into separate
                  modules, and the integration of imperative programming through
                  the introduction of data types whose values may be altered
                  during computation.</span

                  great ideas that have formed the foundation for the recent
                  transformation of life sciences into a fully-fledged
                  computational discipline. Extracting biological understanding
                  from both large and small data sets now requires the use and
                  design of novel algorithms, developed in the field of
                  computational biology. This gateway course is intended as a
                  first exposure to computational biology for first-year
                  undergraduates in the School of Computer Science, although it
                  is open to other computationally minded 6students who are
                  interested in exploring the field. Students will learn
                  fundamental algorithmic and machine learning techniques that
                  are used in modern biological investigations, including
                  algorithms to process string, graph, and image data. They will
                  use these techniques to answer questions such as "How do we
                  reconstruct the sequence of a genome?", "How do we infer
                  evolutionary relationships among many species?", and "How can
                  we predict each gene's biological role?" on biological data.
                  Previous exposure to molecular biology is not required, as the
                  instructors will provide introductory materials as needed.
                  After completion of the course, students will be well equipped
                  to tackle advanced computational challenges in biology.</span
